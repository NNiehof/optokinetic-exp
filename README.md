# optokinetic-exp
Psychophysics experiment that combines the rod-and-frame illusion with large-visual field optokinetic stimulation. Start the experiment by running optokinetic.py. This demonstrates the use of a state machine to run the visual stimuli in one process, and a dynamic sampling procedure in another process.
Note: requires the psi-marginal dynamic sampling procedure to run, see: https://github.com/NNiehof/Psi-staircase
